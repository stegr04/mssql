# If this step fails, logs are in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\...\Setup Bootstrap\Log
# it will often contain the actual error.  If it shows everything passing, the issue is within the DSC logs.
# 
# This module also typically throws this error fpr all failure conditions:
# PowerShell DSC resource MSFT_SqlSetup  failed to execute Set-TargetResource functionality with error message: 
# System.Exception: Test-TargetResource returned false after calling Set-TargetResource.

#
# In particular completing these steps:

# then re-running a failing PowershellDSC job can help you find the source of your error
